# Scanner API Timeout & Infinite Loop Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Timeout Errors**
- **Problem**: External scanner API (`http://89.147.103.119`) was timing out
- **Solution**: Reduced timeout to 3 seconds and added graceful fallback responses
- **Files**: 
  - `src/pages/api/scanner/health.js`
  - `src/pages/api/scanner/tools.js`

### 2. **Browser Infinite Loop**
- **Problem**: Caching mechanism was causing infinite loops during contract loading
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved error handling in pending requests
  - Added proper cleanup of failed requests
  - Fixed cache key management
- **Files**: `src/services/contractScannerApi.js`

### 3. **UI Improvements**
- **Problem**: Scanner showing as "Offline" was blocking functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed status to "Offline (Fallback Mode)" with warning styling
  - Added fallback local pattern matching
  - Scan button works even when external scanner is down
- **Files**: `src/components/audit/ToolsScanCard.js`

## New Features Added

### Fallback Analysis System
When external scanner is unavailable, the system now:
- Performs local pattern-based vulnerability detection
- Checks for common issues: tx.origin usage, unchecked calls, reentrancy, etc.
- Returns properly formatted results that work with existing UI

### Improved Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when external services are down
- Clear user feedback about system status
- No more browser crashes or infinite loops

## Quick Test

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Load any contract**: The system should now work without timeouts
3. **Try scanning**: Should work in fallback mode even with external scanner down

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix scanner timeout and infinite loop issues - add fallback analysis"
git push origin main

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

✅ **No more timeout errors**  
✅ **No more browser crashes/infinite loops**  
✅ **Scanner shows "Offline (Fallback Mode)" instead of just "Offline"**  
✅ **Scanning still works using local pattern matching**  
✅ **Contract loading works normally**  

The app is now resilient to external scanner downtime and provides a better user experience.
