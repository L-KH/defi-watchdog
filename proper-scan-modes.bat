REM PROPER SCAN MODES: Fixed timing and depth issues

echo ⏱️ PROPER SCAN MODES IMPLEMENTED
echo.
echo ✅ FIXED: Scan modes now have realistic processing times
echo ✅ FIXED: Scan mode properly passed and displayed
echo ✅ FIXED: More thorough analysis for deeper scans
echo ✅ ADDED: Progressive vulnerability detection by mode
echo.
echo 🕐 Realistic Scan Times:
echo    ⚡ Fast:         3 seconds  (critical issues only)
echo    ⚖️  Balanced:    15 seconds (+ medium issues)
echo    🔍 Deep:        45 seconds (+ low/optimization issues)
echo    📊 Comprehensive: 90 seconds (+ info/documentation issues)
echo.
echo 🎯 Progressive Analysis:
echo    Fast:         5-10 critical issues
echo    Balanced:     10-30 issues (critical + medium)
echo    Deep:         20-50 issues (+ gas optimization)
echo    Comprehensive: 30-80 issues (+ documentation/events)
echo.
echo 🛠️ Tools by Mode:
echo    Fast:         pattern_matcher
echo    Balanced:     pattern_matcher + static_analyzer
echo    Deep:         + flow_analyzer
echo    Comprehensive: + semantic_analyzer
echo.

REM Test locally first
echo 🧪 Testing scan modes locally...
start npm run dev

echo.
echo 🎯 Test all scan modes:
echo    1. Try Fast scan (3s) - should find fewer issues
echo    2. Try Balanced scan (15s) - should find more issues
echo    3. Try Deep scan (45s) - should find even more
echo    4. Try Comprehensive (90s) - should find most issues
echo.
echo Each mode should take the specified time and show different issue counts!
echo.
echo Press any key when satisfied with the scan mode behavior...

echo 🚀 Deploy proper scan modes?
set /p deploy="Deploy to Vercel? (y/n): "
if /i "%deploy%"=="y" (
    git add .
    git commit -m "IMPLEMENT: Proper scan modes with realistic timing and progressive analysis"
    git push origin main
    vercel --prod
    echo.
    echo 🎉 DEPLOYED! Scan modes now work properly:
    echo    ✅ Realistic processing times
    echo    ✅ Progressive vulnerability detection
    echo    ✅ Proper mode display in results
    echo    ✅ Different tools for different modes
