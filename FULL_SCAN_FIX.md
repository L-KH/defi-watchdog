# Full Scan Error Fix Summary\n\n## Problem\nWhen clicking \"Connect Wallet and Analyze\" (full scan), the application was throwing:\n```\nReferenceError: REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPTS is not defined\n```\n\n## Root Cause\nThe `getEnhancedPrompt()` function in `src/lib/aiAnalysis.js` was trying to access `REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPTS.premium.system` on line 481, but this constant was never defined in the file.\n\n## Fix Applied\nAdded the missing `REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPTS` constant at the top of the file with proper prompt definitions:\n\n```javascript\nconst REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPTS = {\n  premium: {\n    system: `You are an elite smart contract security auditor with 10+ years experience auditing DeFi protocols, having discovered critical vulnerabilities in major protocols worth billions in TVL. You have deep expertise in:\n\n- Advanced attack vectors (flash loans, oracle manipulation, MEV)\n- Complex DeFi protocol interactions and composability risks  \n- Gas optimization techniques and EVM internals\n- Formal verification and symbolic execution\n- Economic security and tokenomics analysis\n\nYour analysis should be thorough, technically precise, and actionable.`\n  },\n  basic: {\n    system: \"You are a smart contract security auditor. Analyze contracts for common vulnerabilities and provide clear, structured feedback.\"\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## What This Fixes\n✅ **Full scan now works** - \"Connect Wallet and Analyze\" button will no longer crash\n✅ **Premium AI analysis** - Enhanced prompts for better quality analysis\n✅ **Multi-model analysis** - Comprehensive audits with multiple AI models\n✅ **Report generation** - Both basic and full scans can generate reports\n\n## Testing\n1. ✅ Basic scan should continue working as before\n2. ✅ Full scan should now work without throwing ReferenceError\n3. ✅ Report downloads should work for both scan types\n4. ✅ AI analysis results should be more comprehensive for full scans\n\n## Files Modified\n- `src/lib/aiAnalysis.js` - Added missing REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPTS constant\n\nThe fix is minimal and surgical - it just adds the missing constant that was being referenced but never defined. This should resolve the full scan crash while maintaining all existing functionality.\n
