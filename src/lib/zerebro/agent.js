Mistral LLM: One thing to note is the batch processing size is appropriately set for Sonic's throughput capabilities.
        
ZerePy Agent: Additionally, the contract properly uses the Sonic Gateway for cross-chain transfers instead of less efficient bridge mechanisms.
        
DeepSeek LLM: I concur with the assessment. The security measures are sound, and the contract makes good use of Sonic's performance advantages.
