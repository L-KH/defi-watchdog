    "overview": "The contract is generally well-designed with several security features like reentrancy guards and locking mechanisms. However, the centralization of operator privileges and the whitelisting of aggregators introduce some risks. The contract's security could be improved by decentralizing critical operations and adding more robust checks on external interactions.\n\nThis contract appears to be optimized for the Sonic blockchain with 1 Sonic-specific optimizations detected.",
