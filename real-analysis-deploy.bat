REM REAL CONTRACT ANALYSIS: Fixed mock data issue

echo 🔍 REAL CONTRACT ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTED
echo.
echo ✅ FIXED: Replaced mock data with real pattern analysis
echo ✅ ADDED: Code-specific vulnerability detection
echo ✅ ADDED: Line-by-line security pattern matching
echo ✅ ADDED: Contract-specific caching (different results for different contracts)
echo.
echo 🎯 Real Analysis Features:
echo    🔍 tx.origin usage detection
echo    ⚠️  Unchecked low-level calls
echo    🚨 Selfdestruct capability checks
echo    ⏰ Timestamp dependence detection
echo    🔄 Reentrancy pattern analysis
echo    🧮 Integer overflow detection
echo    🔒 Access control analysis
echo.
echo 📊 Results now vary by contract:
echo    ✅ Different contracts = Different results
echo    ✅ Real line numbers and code snippets
echo    ✅ Actual vulnerability counts
echo    ✅ Contract-specific recommendations
echo.

REM Test locally first
echo 🧪 Starting localhost for testing...
start npm run dev

echo.
echo 🎯 Test different contracts on localhost:3000:
echo    - Try: 0x2d8879046f1559e53eb052e949e9544bcb72f414 (Linea)
echo    - Try: 0xDd0F30DdC0D6B16B3e1E40bd7e95854246Ec3A13 (Sonic)
echo    - Results should be different for each contract!
echo.
echo Press any key when ready to deploy to Vercel...

REM Deploy
echo 🚀 Deploying real analysis to Vercel...
git add .
git commit -m "MAJOR: Implement real contract analysis - no more mock data"
git push origin main
vercel --prod

echo.
echo 🎉 DEPLOYED! Your scanner now performs real analysis:
echo    ✅ Analyzes actual contract code
echo    ✅ Finds real vulnerabilities
echo    ✅ Provides specific line numbers
echo    ✅ Shows actual code snippets
echo.
echo No more mock data - every contract gets unique analysis!
