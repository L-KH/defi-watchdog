## üîß How to Use the New Features

### 1. Environment Setup

Make sure you have the OpenRouter API key configured:

```bash
# Add to .env.local
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

### 2. Using Different Analysis Tiers

#### Basic Analysis (Free):
```javascript
const result = await analyzeWithAI(sourceCode, contractName, {
  type: 'basic',
  promptMode: 'normal'
});
```

#### Premium Analysis:
```javascript
const result = await analyzeWithAI(sourceCode, contractName, {
  type: 'premium',
  promptMode: 'normal' // or 'aggressive'
});
```

#### Full Security Audit:
```javascript
const result = await analyzeWithAI(sourceCode, contractName, {
  type: 'comprehensive', // or 'full-scan'
  promptMode: 'normal'
});
```

### 3. Custom Analysis Prompts

Users can provide custom analysis instructions:

```javascript
const result = await analyzeWithAI(sourceCode, contractName, {
  type: 'premium',
  promptMode: 'custom',
  customPrompt: 'Focus on flash loan vulnerabilities and MEV protection mechanisms...'
});
```

### 4. Downloading Reports

The system now generates two types of reports:

#### HTML Report (Beautiful, Human-Readable):
- Professional styling with CSS
- Interactive elements
- Print-friendly
- Perfect for presentations and documentation
